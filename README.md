# Estimaker

## Installation

## Notes

- Public Graphs are non-editable and the suffix `Immutable` is used for components and functions that should be kept in sync with their mutable counterparts. We can assume that mutable components and functions work with Liveblocks storage data whereas immutable types work with static data.

TO DO -

Add github script to kick people
Add event listener on page to refresh the page
Do all TO DO's around the repo
Write script that deletes all projects and run that bad boy
